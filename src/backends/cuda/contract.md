# CUDA backend contract

`src/backends/cuda/` is shared by several model engines. Each model owns its own
operations, its own library and its own numerics; this document fixes only the
parts that have to agree for two model libraries to be built, distributed and
validated the same way.

The rule from the [repository layout](../../../README.md) still holds: model
orchestration, batching policy, state management and kernel selection stay with
the model engine. A backend does not need identical internal structures to
another backend, and no universal tensor abstraction is introduced here.

Status: proposed. The checker is [`check_contract.py`](check_contract.py); wiring it
into CI is a separate change, so nothing here is enforced yet.

## Why this exists

Three CUDA efforts are now in flight, each with its own build path:

| Effort | Kernels | Produces | Built by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Laya native (#14) | TileLang, exported to CUDA | `liblaya_cuda.so` | `tools/export.py` + `tools/build.py` |
| Cua-S1 native (#19) | CUDA C++ | `libqwen3_5_cuda.so` | `build.sh` |
| Cua-S1 multimodal (#12) | Triton / cuTile | (Python) | — |

That is three build systems, three library names and three C ABIs. None of it
conflicts today, because nothing links against anything else yet. It conflicts
as soon as one model reuses another's kernels — which is already planned: the
Cua-S1 native worker and a Kev engine share a Qwen3.5 base, and `#9` asks for
CUDA paths for CLM as well.

`#6` says to extract shared code once two implementations exist. Two exist now.
This document is that extraction, kept to interfaces only.

## 1. Artifact discovery

Every CUDA backend declares itself in one JSON file:

```text
src/backends/cuda/<name>/<name>.backend.json
```

The checker discovers backends by that path, so adding a backend needs no CI
change. Schema:

```json
{
  "name": "qwen3_5",
  "abi_version": 1,
  "status": "validated",
  "sources": ["common.cuh", "mma.cuh", "ops.h", "norm.cu", "elementwise.cu",
              "attention.cu", "gdn_prefill.cu", "gemm.cu", "runtime.cu"],
  "models": ["src/models/cua_s1/", "src/models/kev/"],
  "build": {
    "script": "build.sh",
    "output": "libqwen3_5_cuda.so",
    "default_arch": 89,
    "architectures": [89],
    "min_capability": 80
  },
  "numerics": {
    "precision": "bfloat16",
    "accumulation": "float32",
    "tolerance": { "max_abs": 0.039, "note": "float32 reference, see #11" }
  },
  "reference": {
    "entrypoint": "recipe/cua_s1/check_native.py",
    "note": "pinned upstream FourBModel; kernel tolerances are declared per suite"
  }
}
```

Required keys are `name`, `abi_version`, `status`, `sources` and `build`.
`status` is one of:

- `planned` — directory only; the checker skips everything else.
- `experimental` — builds, but no parity claim yet. `numerics.tolerance` may be
  omitted.
- `validated` — a parity claim is made. `numerics.tolerance` and
  `reference.entrypoint` are required, and the checker fails without them.

`reference.entrypoint` is a repository-relative script that runs on a GPU and
exits non-zero when parity fails. It takes no contract-defined arguments: a
self-hosted runner that has the weights and the GPU runs it directly.

### One backend, several models

`models` lists the model engines that consume this backend, as
repository-relative directories. It is optional, and it exists because reuse is
the point: `#19`'s kernels serve a Qwen3.5-4B backbone, and Kev from `#9` uses
the same backbone with a different adapter and readout, so one backend directory
serves both. Without this field that sharing is a private arrangement between
two PRs and invisible to anyone reading either one. An entry naming a directory
that is not in the tree is a warning, not an error, so a backend can be merged
before its second consumer lands.

### Build script interface

`build.script` is invoked by the compile job as:

```sh
./<build.script> <output-dir> <compute-capability>
```

so it must be executable, accept an output directory as `$1`, and accept a
compute capability as `$2` — defaulting to `build.default_arch` when `$2` is
absent. `#19`'s `build.sh` already has this shape:

```sh
out=${1:?usage: build.sh <output dir> [compute capability]}
arch=${2:-${CUDA_COMPUTE_CAP:-89}}
```

This is a deliberate narrowing, and it is the first place the two in-flight
build paths diverge. `#19` builds from a shell script that emits one library.
`#14` builds through `tools/export.py` and `tools/build.py`, which are Python
programs driven by a TileLang export step and take a bundle directory, not an
output directory plus an architecture. A backend of that shape satisfies the
contract with a small `build.sh` wrapper that documents the real invocation
rather than by CI growing a second code path. Making that wrapper the required
entry point keeps CI one path and makes "how do I build this backend" answerable
from the manifest alone.

## 2. C ABI

A backend library exports a flat `extern "C"` interface and is loaded at run
time, so a Rust engine builds without a CUDA toolkit. `#19`'s `ops.h` is the
reference for the shape. The contract fixes four points:

1. **One version symbol per library.** A backend exports
   `uint32_t <prefix>_abi_version(void)`. A loader refuses a library whose value
   it does not know.
2. **Errors are `int`, not exceptions.** Every entry point returns `0` on
   success. CUDA runtime errors are returned as `cudaError_t` values; anything
   the library defines itself starts at `1000`. Every library exports
   `const char* <prefix>_error_string(int)`.
3. **Work is queued on a caller-supplied stream.** Operations take a
   `cudaStream_t` as their last argument and must not synchronize internally, so
   that a caller can capture them into a CUDA Graph. Allocations, copies, stream
   creation and graph capture are exported by the library too, so a caller needs
   no direct CUDA linkage.
4. **GEMM algorithm choice is explicit and reproducible.** A tuned plan is
   exported and imported rather than re-tuned at load. A plan that reduces
   split-K in place must be refused, so a given plan always produces the same
   result.

Point 3 is what makes two model libraries composable: a model engine that
already owns a stream and a captured graph can call into either library.

### Runtime symbol sharing

`#19`'s runtime block (`malloc`, `free`, `stream_create`, `stream_sync`,
`upload`, `download`, `graph_begin`, `graph_end`, `graph_launch`,
`graph_destroy`, `device_info`, `set_device`) is the same work every backend
needs. Implementing it per library means two libraries loaded into one process
each carry a copy, and a graph captured through one cannot be launched through
the other.

Extracting that set into one shared header is a follow-up, deliberately not part
of this change: there is only one backend today, so the shape of the shared
surface would be guesswork. It becomes worth doing when a second backend
actually needs to be loaded alongside the first, and the interface can be
written against two real callers instead of an imagined one.

## 3. Numerics

Bit-exactness is not claimed anywhere, so the contract records what varies
instead of leaving it to be discovered in a parity failure:

- **Rounding points.** Where each kernel rounds to the storage dtype is part of
  the kernel's documentation. `#19`'s `qwen3_5/README.md` is the model: it names
  the kernels that round where the Transformers reference rounds, and the
  attention and Gated DeltaNet paths that keep bfloat16 intermediates as
  FlashAttention and flash-linear-attention do.
- **Accumulation.** Float32 unless documented otherwise.
- **Tolerance.** Declared before comparison, per suite, in
  `numerics.tolerance`. A single end-to-end number is not enough: an end-to-end
  check cannot localize a failure to one kernel.
- **Architecture.** `build.architectures` lists the compute capabilities the
  library is built for. A kernels file that requires a newer capability than the
  build script's default is a contract error — `#19`'s `attention.cu` documents
  sm_80+, while `#14` builds sm_90a only.
- **Kernel requirement.** `build.min_capability` states the oldest compute
  capability the kernels actually compile for. It exists because that fact is
  currently only in prose — `#19`'s `gdn_prefill.cu` and `mma.cuh` both say
  "sm_80 and later" in a header comment, and its README says "Tensor-core kernels
  need sm_80 or newer". One integer turns that into something CI checks: every
  entry in `build.architectures` must be at least `build.min_capability`, so a
  library cannot claim a target its own kernels reject. The field is optional;
  a backend that omits it declares no verified floor, which is honest but not
  checked.

## 4. Validation

Two tiers, because they have different requirements.

**Tier 1 — contract check (no GPU).** `check_contract.py` reads the manifests and
the build scripts and checks: the schema, that every declared source exists, that
a build script declares the architectures the manifest claims and writes the
library the manifest names, that an ABI version is consistent across backends, and
that a `validated` backend declares both a tolerance and a reference entrypoint.
It runs on a stock runner and needs no CUDA toolkit. This is the tier implemented
in this change.

It does not compile CUDA and does not prove numerics.

**Tier 2 — compile (no GPU).** Building each backend with `nvcc` in a CUDA
container, so a kernel that stops compiling cannot land. The interface it relies
on is the one Tier 1 already checks: `./<build.script> <output-dir>
<compute-capability>`, producing exactly the declared library. Not yet wired up;
it needs a container image and belongs with the rest of the CI wiring rather than
with the checker.

Note what a build check does and does not prove. It shows the sources compile and
that a file of the declared name appears. It does not prove the binary honoured
`build.architectures`: `#19`'s `build.sh` advertises that it "also embeds PTX",
and nothing reads the artifact to confirm which targets are inside. Inspecting
that would need `cuobjdump`, which is a reasonable follow-up rather than
something this change claims to do.

**Tier 3 — GPU parity (self-hosted).** Running each validated backend's
`reference.entrypoint` on a real GPU, and reporting kernel-level and end-to-end
parity separately. Contributors with a card can attach their own runner to their
own fork, which is how `#19` (RTX 6000 Ada, sm_89), `#12` (RTX 4090) and `#14`
(H800, sm_90a) can each be checked on the hardware they were measured on. Not yet
wired up.

The split is the point. A CPU-only workflow that claims to validate CUDA is worse
than no workflow, which is the gap `#14`'s own validation report already records:
today's CI checks every Rust feature and compiles no CUDA at all. Tier 1 removes
the part of that gap which does not need hardware; Tiers 2 and 3 need hardware and
are therefore separate.

## Reporting

Kernel-level and end-to-end results stay separate, and both report the hardware,
driver, CUDA version, compute capability, source revision and tolerance that
applied. Load, warmup and warm latency are reported separately. A run that does
not establish an improvement reports that, rather than an acceleration claim.
