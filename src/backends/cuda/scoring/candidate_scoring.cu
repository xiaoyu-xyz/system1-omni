// Fused candidate scoring: query + candidate matrix -> probabilities, one pass.
//
// What this replaces is several launches over an intermediate the caller never
// wanted: materialise similarities, find the max, exponentiate, sum, divide. For
// a decision model that is most of the readout, and the candidate matrix is read
// once per stage instead of once in total.
//
// The fusion that matters here is narrower and more useful than "fewer
// launches": when the similarity is a cosine, each candidate's norm and its dot
// with the query need exactly the same elements, so both accumulate in one read
// of C. That halves the traffic over the candidate matrix, which for Kev means
// 255 rows of 2560 floats.
//
// Layout: one thread block per question; each warp owns candidates in a strided
// loop and reduces its dot with warp shuffles; the block then does a stable
// softmax over the K similarities in shared memory. K is at most 255, so the
// whole similarity vector fits in shared memory and the softmax needs no second
// kernel and no atomics. Batching is a grid over questions, not a loop of
// launches.
//
// Accumulation is float32, which is what a model engine would do; the reference
// in reference.py accumulates in float64 so the error is measured against the
// true value rather than against another float32 path.
//
// NOT COMPILED OR RUN. There is no CUDA toolkit on the authoring machine. See
// README.md for exactly what is and is not verified.

// Bumped whenever the required interface below changes. The manifest repeats it
// as `abi_version` and the checker compares the two, so the number lives here
// once: a manifest that drifts from this macro is reported rather than trusted.
