# System1-Omni

A community-maintained inference engine for prefill-only System1-Omni models, designed around a Rust frontend, model-owned execution, and high-performance CUDA and Metal backends.

The Rust frontend forwards requests to a separately running model worker. In-repository model engines and GPU backends are not implemented yet.

## Run the frontend

From the repository root, with stable Rust installed:

```sh
cargo build --release --locked
OMNI_JEV_BIND=127.0.0.1:8080 \
OMNI_JEV_BACKEND_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000 \
  ./target/release/omni-jev
```

Start the worker separately. See the [frontend documentation](src/frontend/README.md)
for the HTTP interface and configuration, or the [Laya recipe](recipe/laya/README.md)
for a CPU text worker and response checks.

## Architecture

Share serving infrastructure; let each model own its execution.

![System1-Omni architecture: Rust frontend, model-owned execution, and CUDA and Metal backends](docs/assets/architecture.svg)

| Layer | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Rust frontend | API, request lifecycle, and response delivery through a small engine interface. |
| System1-Omni models | Model-specific preprocessing and postprocessing, batching, state, execution, and kernel selection. |
| CUDA backend | High-performance GPU operations for NVIDIA GPUs. |
| Metal backend | High-performance GPU operations for Apple GPUs. |

Each model owns its complete request-to-result path. Shared utilities stay minimal and are extracted when implementations need the same functionality. Backends can optimize for their hardware without requiring identical internal implementations.

## Repository layout

Implementation code lives under `src/`; recipes and documentation stay at the repository root.

| Directory | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| [`src/frontend/`](src/frontend/) | Rust serving code and the small engine interface. |
| [`src/models/laya/`](src/models/laya/) | LAYA preprocessing, batching, state, execution, and output processing. |
| [`src/backends/cuda/`](src/backends/cuda/) | NVIDIA GPU operations and kernel integration. |
| [`src/backends/metal/`](src/backends/metal/) | Apple GPU operations and kernel integration. |
| [`recipe/`](recipe/) | Model setup instructions, launch commands, configuration examples, and example requests. |
| [`docs/`](docs/) | Project documentation and architecture assets. |

The frontend and Laya checkpoint reader are Cargo workspace members. Model execution and GPU backends remain planned; these directories do not prescribe process boundaries.

## Supported models

LAYA can run as an external Python worker for text requests. Its in-repository model engine is still planned:

| Model | Status |
| --- | --- |
| LAYA | [External worker](recipe/laya/README.md); [CPU checkpoint reader](src/models/laya/README.md); model execution planned |

CUDA and Metal coverage will be documented per model as implementations are added and validated.
